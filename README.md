# YouTube Comments Project

Sentiment Analysis is a NLP technique that is often used to determine whether text is Positive , Negative , or Neutral. The purpose of this project was to perform a sentiment analysis on YouTube comments. I was curious how the mean/median sentiment of comments for a video would interact with other video metrics such as Video Views and Total Comment Count.

I used a RoBERTa-base model trained on 124M posts and fine-tuned for sentiment analysis. [Model Used](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest)

I created an interactive Tableau dashboad that can be viewed at:
