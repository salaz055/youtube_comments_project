      "> True Don't send it back. This video is a gem. Bro, remember when Logan Paul got taken for $3M on Pokemon cards. It's a life lesson learned and a you posted it for all our friends. Remember success is a journey not a destination. Keep grinding!\n",
      "> False Hes not scamming his sister probably got it for him and lied saying it was kobes writing\n",
      "> True He offered your money back definitely not a scammer and word of advice let them know they are being recorded avoid legal fees and being sued.\n",
      "> False Isn’t it hard authenticate a signature. If Kobe is signing tons of stuff, he would mess up from time to time.\n",
      "> True He answered the phone, definitely not trying to scam you out of money\n",
      "> False The seller has a legit point tho. At the end of the day we're all just guessing.\n",
      "> True Still a cool piece nonetheless 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️ I would drop a few bands for that ngl\n",
      "> True he is either 100% real or really good at what he does... \n",
      "but i would actually feel like he was real and i would keep the ball\n",
      "> False \"Sign balls\"😳📸\n",
      "> True The fact they are answering the phone, speaking to you and not yelling and being defensive tells me it's most likely real. But like he said, send it back\n",
      "> False He seems legit ngl\n",
      "> False Go back from the start of his career till he died and see if he autograph ever changed much\n",
      "> True It’s real bro, dude is way too chill, and like he said, why would they authenticate anything after his death? You’d be better off getting a ball signed by Shaq or Jordan tbh, just cuz they would be able to verify it themselves\n",
      "> True I have a feeling it's real now the guy if pretty chill and even asking if he wants to give it back\n",
      "> False \"Kobe used to come and sign balls for us\"\n",
      "> True Seems sketchy that now they can say “Oh! Yeah that doesn’t mean anything, they don’t authenticate unless they were there for the signing” basically saying that there’s no such thing as an authentic Kobe autograph without proof anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since PSA and Beckett has taken that stance memorabilia stores probably have a back room with several dudes signing Kobe stuff. He was cool about it though and offered a refund so that’s good.\n",
      "> False Beckett and PsA are trash with inperson nonevent shit. Like if you get something signed at a game etc they don’t guarantee it because the rushed version looks different. This guy is probably claiming they got these from a young Kobe who signed a thousand and didn’t give a shit so they usually won’t pass. \n",
      "\n",
      "They are usually the best for authenticating stuff that came out of formal signings (sitting at an event with it on a table and taking more time) and only really mess with stuff outside of that for older players.  \n",
      "\n",
      "A fail doesn’t mean it isn’t real, it just means they won’t stake their name on it. And with the flood of Kobe shit post death that makes sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus this guy sounds way too casual to be passing off fakes. The offer of a refund is big\n",
      "> False How long are you going to talk about this ball\n",
      "> False This dudes videos are pretty well made but his “ side hustles” couldn’t be any dumber\n",
      "> False Is not worth it tho a 400 ball\n",
      "> False Honestly dudes really chill, if he is a scammer, it takes a lot to answer a phone call from someone who bought your product but he responded way too quickly and smoothly for me to think he’s a scammer, maybe the ball is fake maybe not, but what he’s saying makes sense and is logical\n",
      "> False He’s right about Beckett to, their card grading recently took a big dive in people using them  after a video came out of someone using PSA getting a 10 and then sending the exact card to Beckett and getting an 8!\n",
      "> True After watching Karl Jobst talk about video game authentication I can see what the seller is saying to be some what ture. Karl Jobst does a fantastic video on how authenticators took advantage of the video game market\n",
      "> False Kobe signing those balls though.\n",
      "> False So as a hobby I like to collect vintage goods like games/ consoles and anything electronic. I know it’s not the same as a Kobe signed ball, but the same premise of things being real or fake. Usually if someone fakes something and tries to scam you they will not pick up the phone, return calls because that’s happened to me and other people I know. So the fact that this guy returned, or answered really, the call and actually was speaking in a straightforward manner, didn’t stutter or anything. He also offered a refund as well at the end there, so I’m thinking he’s pretty legitimate. Not many scammers act like this guy, and I also know PSA can be really stingy about shit considering I follow a lot of card grading companies and YouTubers who get stuff graded.\n",
      "> False Ngl a real ball more likely be inconsistent as the nature of the autograph be different depending on the situation. Like someone could just study how someone sign and fake it.\n",
      "> True Bernie Madoff always offered to give people their money back ...\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      ".. it sure seems way more legit when he offered to return the ball. Good sales tactic or legit?? \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh the humanity!\n",
      "> True For some reason I really believe that guy on the phone, he didn’t stutter or have to think about what he was saying at all. Scammers usually stutter or pause frequently because they are trying to remember what they’re supposed to say like a script but for many different questions and answers. Plus he even answered the phone and was easy going.\n",
      "> False The only reason he was \"chill\" was becsuse sellers have to be or they will get negative reviews and their ebay channel will be doneskees.\n",
      "I thought it was sketchy when he said \"Kobe comes in and signs balls for us.\"\n",
      "Why the f*** would kobe sign balls so a dude on ebay could sell them, he wouldnt.\n",
      "> False So this prompted me to do some research into Beckett ain't a great company from what I can find even worse than PSA and those people are something else\n",
      "> False Bro you're milking this autographed shit...\n",
      "> False Y'all he never said anything about a refund, he just said \"send it back\"\n",
      "> True I think it’s definitely real, some of the stuff on the paper from Beckett was stuff you can’t even tell just from examining it\n",
      "> True Half of the errors they mentioned I feel like could be due to it being a paint pen at least it looks like a paint pen to me I could see some kid coming up to him wanting him to sight it and he wrote over it again because the pen didn’t work\n",
      "> False I think it legit if it was a younger Kobe it changed over time\n",
      "> True Help me me seen! I won the MacBook book and trying to get ahold of Stevie! Much love everyone!\n",
      "> False I think that it is real just because he seems really chill and the story lines up because when Kobe was younger he probably did a slightly different autograph and the guy wouldn’t take it back if it was fake\n",
      "> True Imagine if it truly is a real ball\n",
      "> False https://youtube.com/shorts/AtNoPP8yYic?feature=share\n",
      "> True This guy handled everything well that other ball was for sure fake though ...\n",
      "> True Maybe I'm gullible but I kinda believe him.\n",
      "The fact he's willing to take it back is a good sign.\n",
      "> True That shits real Stevie, that guy was being honest\n",
      "> False The Beckett ppl make sense tho, the signature looks forged.\n",
      "> False keep it\n",
      "> False 😂 did not expect that\n",
      "> True Or give it to me plz\n",
      "> False Don’t send it back keep it\n",
      "> True Prolly genuine. Guy is either a master liar/told the story a hundred times or is telling the truth. Occam’s Razor says its legit and Beckett is POS (which I already believed tbh)\n",
      "> False How would they witness an autograph if kobe been dead bro makes no sense\n",
      "> False Wait a second… if he has sent stuff to Beckett himself, how does he not know how much people pay to get it authenticated? 🤔 phishy…\n"
